ZapBox!
=======

The "ZapBox!" edition has been created to be as compact as possible, while maintaining easy access to the charging port and buttons. It's constructed from two parts, the main case and lid.

No screws are necessary, everything fits together nice and snug, like a pig in a blanket.

Recommended material: PLA or PETG

Printing advice: Add supports to the charging port and buttons slot. Be sure there are no supports interfering with the four lid/case fixing points.
