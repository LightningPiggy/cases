LightningPiggy Block Lamp
=========================

Shining a light on sound money: This Minecraft-inspired savings' lamp, a first of its kind, was ingeniously crafted by Silexperience and his son. The project was sparked by a curious question from his son, "Can bitcoin be in a piggy bank?" This led to the idea of integrating a LightningPiggy device inside a block shaped lamp.

We love how the LightningPiggy device can seamlessly integrated into any object and in this case it looks like an artefact of the bitcoin blockchain.

Recommended material: PLA or PETG

Printing advice: No support needed except for the main cube 20% filling supports 5% (cube only)

Build notes: Power is provided using a 1,800 mah lithium battery connected directly to the T5's USB port. The LED strip and the Lilygo are independent at the time of writing.
