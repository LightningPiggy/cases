# GenesisPiggy

BlackCoffee's original cardboard pig has been reimagined in filament and can now be printed as easily, and cheaply, as fiat money. This is a draft design so expect some tweaks and please do share any ideas you may have to improve it.

Device Support: LilyGo T5 V2.3.1 (2.13 inch)

Recommended material: PLA or PETG

Printing advice: Print back down (trotters up). Add supports everything except for the tail. Be sure to remove all support materials from around where the board sits. A small flat head screwdriver might be needed if there are difficult to remove pieces of filament remaining.
