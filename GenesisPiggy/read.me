BlackCoffee's original cardboard pig has been reimagined in filament and can now be printed as easily, and cheaply, as fiat money. This is a draft design so expect some tweaks and please do share any issues you may face or ideas you have to improve it.
Recommended material: PLA or PETG
Printing advice: Print lying on it's back (trotters up). Add supports everything except for the tail.The board is quite a tight fit but will go in if there are no bits of filament in the way.
